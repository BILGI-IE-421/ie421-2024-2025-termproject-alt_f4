    <h1>Total Medals to GDP</h1>
    <p>The 2024 Paris Olympics were incredibly exciting for everyone. The number of medals won varied greatly, with some countries winning none while others, like the United States, secured dozens. But is there a connection between these differences in medal counts?</p>
    
    <p>Countries' levels of development are measured by various parameters. The Human Development Index (HDI) reflects a country’s level of human development. A country scores a higher HDI when life expectancy is greater, education levels are higher, and the gross national income (GNI) per capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity) is higher. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period. The Gini coefficient measures income inequality within a country, assessing the distribution of wealth or income among its population.</p>
    
    <p>Developed countries often outperform developing or underdeveloped countries in various fields, including arts, technology, health, and sports. But did the level of development of countries help them win medals in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics? We’ll explore this question using HDI, the Gini Coefficient, and GDP as indicators.</p>
